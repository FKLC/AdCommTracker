# Adventure Communist Capsule Tracker
A capsule tracker for Adventure Communist game. The other capsule trackers were not mobile friendly so I decided to do my own version. It is really basic nothing too complicated. Made just to pass some time.

## Thanks
Cycle data and the images are from the [Fandom Wiki](https://adventurecommunist.fandom.com/wiki/Free_capsules). Inspired by [Scripter17](https://github.com/scripter17/adcomm-capsule-finder/)'s and [Zephyron1237](https://github.com/zephyron1237/adcom-capsule-tracker)'s capsule trackers.

## Contribution
